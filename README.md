DCI scores from 2000 onwards

This repository contains compiled DCI scores, going back to 2000. Why 2000? It's the first season in which DCI had the 40-30-30 format of scoring with subcaptions that closely resemble those used today. That said, this repository may include more years in the future.

This data comes from 2 sources. Each has their own file format:

- [fromthepressbox.com](https://fromthepressbox.com/dca-dcihistory), which is used to get all scores prior to 2014. 

- [dci.org](https://dci.org/scores), which is used to get all scores from 2014 and onwards. This site could be used for 2013 scores, but at last check fromthepressbox had more complete recap information. 

The `combined` folder contains a merged score file with detail from both datasets. 

The code used to scrape the data from each source is not yet publicly available, but may be in the future.
